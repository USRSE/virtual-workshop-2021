## Call for Proposals

We invite submissions for the 2021 US-RSE Virtual Workshop to be held virtually on two non-consecutive days: May 24 and 27, 2021. The theme of this year’s workshop will be “A Path forward for Research Software Engineers.” Suggested submission topics include but are not limited to: presentations of tools with focus on collaboration, re-usability and reproducibility, presentations about RSE teams, career paths, training, management, and community. The following types of proposals can be submitted:

- **Talks**: 15 min presentations plus 5 minute questions. Please submit abstracts of no more than 500 words.
- **Breakout discussion topics**: topics to be discussed by participants in breakout sessions. This can be anything of interest to the community, such as proposals for new working groups, initiatives within the community, or issues related to the RSE profession. Please submit a short summary (no more than 200 words) about the suggested topic, questions to be discussed, and envisioned outcomes of the breakout session.

### Submission
